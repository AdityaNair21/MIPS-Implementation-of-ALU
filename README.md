# MIPS Implementation of ALU
 
This project is the binary implemtation of an ALU using logical operations. 

Along with the project is a [report](https://github.com/AdityaNair21/MIPS-Implementation-of-ALU/blob/main/Report%20-%20MIPS%20ALU.pdf) which will explain the high-level conceptual idea of an ALUâ€™s logical operations and also dive into the code to show
how this can be implemented. The operations which will be covered are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
